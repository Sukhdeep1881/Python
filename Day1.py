# Guido Van Rossum in 1989 created Python
# and is a dynamically typed, interpreted and high level language
# dynamic means doesn't need to pre-define datatype , interpreted means easier to work and faster code writing
# However less efficient than runtime than program written in compiled languages
# High level provide contextual information and error checking
# support object-oriented programming approach as well as functional programming approach
